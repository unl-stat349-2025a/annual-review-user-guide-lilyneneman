# Randomized Response Technique (RRT)

The Randomized Response Technique is used for handling sensitive questions in surveys. It allows respondents to answer sensitive questions truthfully while maintaining their privacy. 

My user guide will cover a brief introduction to what RRT is, how it works, and why it is useful. I will also cover when the appropriate time to use RRT and examples of how it might be implemented. It will include how to set up an RRT survey in R and the packages needed to implement it.
