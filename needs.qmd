Someone trying to use the Randomized Response Technique (RRT) will likely need help understanding how it works and when to use it. They will also likely need help setting up and analyzing an RRT survey in R.

Understanding the concept could be tricky for some individuals but I think the trickiest part would be using R to set up the survey for beginners. 

There are many research papers explainin RRT and also online tutorials for R survey setups. There are also R packages that include tutorials for this task.
